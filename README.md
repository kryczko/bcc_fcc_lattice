bcc_fcc_lattice
===============

This program promps the user whether they would like to plot up an fcc or bcc cubic lattice. The user also has an option for how many rows/columns/stacks and the name of the output file. The lattice is made from carbon atoms; it can/will be updated when other atoms are needed to be plotted. The output file is meant to be plotted in the program vmd.
